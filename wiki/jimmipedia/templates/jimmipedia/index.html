                                The history of the Nashville Sounds, a Minor League Baseball team, began in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1978, after Larry Schmittou and a group of American investors purchased the rights to operate an expansion franchise of the Double-A level Southern League. Home games were played at Herschel Greer Stadium from its opening in 1978 until the end of 2014. In 2015, they moved to the new First Horizon Park (pictured) on the site of the former Sulphur Dell ballpark. They won the league's championship in 1979 as an affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds and in 1982 as an affiliate of the New York Yankees. Before the 1985 season, the owners bought the Evansville Triplets, a Triple-A team, and relocated them to Nashville as the Triple-A Sounds. They joined the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998 and won its championship in 2005 as an affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. In 2021, they were placed in the Triple-A East, which became the International League in 2022. (This article is part of a featured topic: Nashville Sounds.)

The white-headed petrel (Pterodroma lessonii), also known as the white-headed fulmar, is a species of seabird in the petrel family, Procellariidae. About 400 mm (16 in) in length, the species occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, and breeds alone or in colonies in burrows dug among tussocks and herbfields on subantarctic islands. This white-headed petrel in flight was photographed off the eastern coast of the Tasman Peninsula in Tasmania, Australia.
